            The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA).[2] 
            It changed its name to the National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, 
            after merging with the competing National Basketball League (NBL).[3] 
            The NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games. 
            The league's playoff tournament extends into June. As of 2020, 
            NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.
